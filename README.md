# Schedule Application

## Description

This project was created for a user to scheudle out a typical nine to five workday by the hour. The website can be used by typing in a task to complete in the text box next to the hour in which the user would like to work on that task. To the right of each text box is a save button the user can click to save their task to the browser's local storage. Once saved, the tasks will stay in their respective text boxes and persist through refresh or exiting the page. The text boxes will also change colors depending on the time of day the website is accessed. The text boxes will change to gray if the hour has already passed, red if it is currently that hour, and green if the hour is in the future. The website is primarily run by jQuery and day.js to generate the text boxes with their associated hours and is styled using BootStrap, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome.
